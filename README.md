# DA-RNN: Semantic Mapping with Data Associated Recurrent Neural Networks

Created by Yu Xiang at RSE-Lab at University of Washington.

### Introduction

we introduce Data Associated Recurrent Neural Networks (DA-RNNs), a novel framework for joint 3D scene mapping and semantic labeling. DA-RNNs use a new recurrent neural network architecture for semantic labeling on RGB-D videos. The output of the network is integrated with mapping techniques such as KinectFusion in order to inject semantic information into the reconstructed 3D scene.
